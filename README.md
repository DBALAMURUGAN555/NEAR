Bitcoin Yield Vaults (Trustless, ICP-Powered)

Core Innovation:

Direct Bitcoin + DeFi: Use ICP’s chain-key Bitcoin to enable native BTC deposits (no wrapping/bridges).
Triple-Collateral Loans: Borrowers collateralize with BTC + ICP + Stablecoins, reducing liquidation risks (vs. volatile single-asset collateral).
Inflation-Resistant Yield:
Lenders earn yield in BTC (not inflationary tokens).
Borrowers pay interest in ICP/stables (hedging Bitcoin volatility).

Real-World Relevance:

 - For Emerging Markets: Unbanked users can borrow against BTC without KYC.
 - For Institutions: Compliant vaults with on-chain KYC (e.g., Chainalysis oracles) for regulated entities.
 - Post-Bitcoin ETF Use Case: ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT ($20B AUM) could use this for institutional-grade lending.
